# systolicarray
this repo is a detailed synthesisiable code of a systolic array in VERILOG for neural network applications, these systems do not use any memory hence making them have an edge in area and power.


sysarray44-this represents a fully hardcoded systolic array which is 4x4


sysarray44to16-this is a 16x16 system which uses 4x4 array to further reduce area and power


sysarray1616-fully hardcoded 16x16 array
